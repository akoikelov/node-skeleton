# **About Renewable Map**
With Climate change being one of the most complex issues facing our society,
there has been an massive increase in the demand for using renewable energy.
Two of the main forms of renewable energy are wind and solar power, and they
are one of the few resources available almost everywhere. With the increase
in demand to use these sources of energy, its crucial to be able to assess
their availability, and that's when Renewable Map comes in use. Renewable
Map is an interactive map with a heat map layer that displays to the user the
availability of solar and wind power throughout the year.

# **How to use Renewable Map**
Renewable Map can be used to get information about the availability of wind 
and solar resources through three different options. The user can use the 
heat map to get a general idea of the availability of these resources, the 
region box to plot the average of the points enclosed by the box, and 
lastly, the display chart on a specific point to get specific information 
for a point selected by the user.

## Using the heat map
The heat map will always be displayed on the interactive map to give the user a 
general idea of the availability of wind and solar resources. The dark color is
an indication of availability of these resources, and the color becomes lighter 
as the availability decreases. This option will be mostly used for a quick overview,
and it can be used with the other two display options to get more in-depth and
specific data.

## Using the region box
The second display option is using the region box. The region box will provide the
user with information about the specific region of their choice. The user will drop two pins
on the map, and those two points will create a rectangle that will be used to plot the average
availability of the solar and wind resources throughout the year. In order to create the 
region box, the user has to hold the shift key and choose the two points.

## Using the display charts for a specific point
The third display option is using the display chart for a single point. This will
display a chart with the availability of the wind and solar resources throughout the
year. The charts will be generated using the data closest to the point selected by the
user.

# **Data Sources**
The solar and wind data were both obtained from the NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center: Global 
Data Sets data base.
